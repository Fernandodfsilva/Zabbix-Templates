Zabbix-Templates
================

Zabbix-Templates for Zabbix 2.4 and on

Here are templates for devices that I use daily at my Wireless ISP

For devices with 5.5.* firmware the mikrotik Mib will have to be loaded 

For devices with 5.6.* firmware the Ubnt Mib's will have to be loaded and the
airmax templates imported before the device templates as they are linked.

For Airfibers the Ubnt Mib's will have to be loaded.
