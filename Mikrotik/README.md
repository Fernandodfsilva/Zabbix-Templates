Zabbix-Templates
================

Zabbix-Templates for Zabbix 2.4 and 3.1

Here are templates for devices that I use daily at my Wireless ISP

I have removed all the mikrotik device specific and created a universal template that uses discovery to find interfaces. This template will only work for devices that do not use wireless. There will be a seperate wireless template that can be added as a linked template.

Multiple Processors
===================

Devices that use multiple processors are not supported for any other CPU than (0) under the universal template right now. Next time I have free time I will be adding that support.
